I’m a data scientist with a passion for solving problems and using data, mathematics and technology to help businesses make informed decisions, optimise processes and add value to end-users. Some programming tools that I enjoy working with include SQL, Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Currently, I’m pursuing my further studies to hone my data-wrangling, analytical and machine-learning skills and build reliable, efficient artificial intelligence tools.
